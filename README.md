# Air-Pollution-Prediction-uing-Machine-Learning
The project "Prediction of Air Pollution using Random Forest" explores the use of machine learning techniques to forecast air pollution levels, particularly the Air Quality Index (AQI). The study leverages historical air quality data from government monitoring stations and applies various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes. After evaluating these models based on accuracy metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the research concludes that the Random Forest algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 98.49%. The project also develops a Flask-based web application that allows users to input pollution data and receive AQI predictions, demonstrating the practical application of the model. The findings highlight the importance of AI-driven approaches in enhancing air quality monitoring, aiding policymakers, and improving public health outcomes.
The study discusses the limitations of traditional air quality monitoring systems, which rely on sparse sensor networks, and proposes AI-powered predictive modeling as a scalable and efficient alternative. It reviews existing research on air pollution impacts, seasonal variations, and indoor air quality challenges, emphasizing the need for real-time data integration from IoT sensors for improved accuracy. The project suggests future advancements, such as deep learning techniques, user-friendly interfaces, and policy-driven action plans, to further enhance air pollution prediction and mitigation strategies. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical role of AI/ML in addressing environmental challenges, providing valuable insights for governments, researchers, and environmental agencies working to combat air pollution.
